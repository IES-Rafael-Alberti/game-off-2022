We are a group of students from IES Rafael Alberti, in Cadiz, Spain. We are studying a specialization in video games and virtual reality, and we wanted to test our skills by participating in a game jam. Our idea is to make a game that we ourselves would like to play, that is full of cliches and laughs where you can have a good time.

BAKER's Bizarre Adventure
The game is about Maurice and Louise, two baker siblings who work in the kingdom of Very Very Close. The princess of the kingdom is lost and the king has offered a large sum of money to the local who finds her. All the villagers because of greed have started attacking each other to prevent the others from finding the princess before them. Our baker, no less, embarks on an adventure in order to rescue the princess and get the money, I mean, it's MONEY!

We are doing the development of the project in this [github repository](https://github.com/IES-Rafael-Alberti/game-off-2022). There will be information about the game in a GDD that we will upload to the [wiki](https://github.com/IES-Rafael-Alberti/game-off-2022/wiki).
We follow the SCRUM methodology whose tasks and iterations are reflected in the [project](https://github.com/IES-Rafael-Alberti/game-off-2022/projects?query=is%3Aopen)
You can find more information in our [itch page](https://babushas.itch.io/gameoff2022) and in our [github page](https://ies-rafael-alberti.github.io/game-off-2022/)
